Even though Scala is quite an advanced programming language, itâ€™s not ideal and there is always room for improvements. Dotty is a complete redesign of the Scala compiler that has a solid theoretical foundation and promises better performance. It will introduce many new features, change and remove existing ones. We will look at some changes that have already landed into master and briefly cover future work.
